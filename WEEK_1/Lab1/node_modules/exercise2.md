1. **Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?****

#==>**setImmediate()** is useful when we want to defer running some code or calling some callback until AFTER the current event has been fully processed and control returned back to the event loop.
#==>When we are  trying to not block the event loop for too long. we may run a chunk of code, then call setImmediate() and run the next chunk of code when the setImmediate() callback gets called and so on. This allows the processing of other events that arrive in the event loop in between your chunks of processing.
#==>we want to call a callback, but we want to call it asynchronously so that the callers code that comes after gets to run before you call the callback.
#=>=>>event-loop starts from timming phase(setTimeout,setInterval),then I/O and internal codes,lastly immidiate('check phase'), sometimes it is better when we want to execute immidiately without using waiting time as soon as other finished but before I/O callbacks run.
#=>if we move the two calls within an I/O cycle and we want to execute some callbacks first, the immediate callback is always execute first.

```
// timeout_vs_immediate.js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('timeout');
  }, 0);
  setImmediate(() => {
    console.log('immediate');
  });
});
```

2. **Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?****

*****process.nextTick()**=>is not technically part of the event loop, all callbacks passed to process.nextTick() will be resolved before the event  loop continues; process.nextTick fires more immediately than setImmediate()

*****setImmediate()**=> is part of the event loop. it fires on the following iteration or 'tick' of the event loop
